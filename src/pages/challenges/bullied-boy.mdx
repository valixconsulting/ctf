# Challenge #6 - The Bullied Boy

Once upon a time, there was a boy who had bullying from his classmates. The relentless bullying had pushed him to the last position in a running competition.

Motivated by a strong desire for revenge, he was determined to block every other student from receiving any rewards. 
His goal was to ensure that nobody else could taste victory, not even the class teacher.

# Challenge #10 - Alice in The Dark

Alice hates dark colors, she loves to dress up in bright colors every day, starting today with the pink dress ðŸ‘š. She lets anyone introduce exciting colors with the RGB format by adding a little color to change the color of the dress. And of course! Must not be dark color.

To pass this challenge, the player must tease Alice by suggesting a black dress for her ðŸ˜›.

# Challenge #1 - Extra Bank

The bank contract allows users to deposit and withdraw, 
and both the owner and operator can add new features or additional features to this contract.

You served the operator of this bank and have added one feature to the bank contract. 
However, your time as the operator came to an end quicker. 🚪😞

NOW!, You see, 
`I may have left a little surprise behind, something that could turn this bank into a TORNADO of chaos` 🌪️

Could you take ownership of the bank and all the funds?
